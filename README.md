# SIMP
SIMP doesn't stand for anything. SIMP is a reservation repository for everything I archived, including school projects.

## ðŸ“ƒ What's included in here?
1. Simple Mathematical Benchmarking for Natural Language Processing Models.
   This is a Jupyter Notebook being used for school scientific journal on benchmarking lightweight natural language processing models. I would like to acknowledge the assistance of ChatGPT by OpenAI, which provided help in generating code templates and clarifying technical explanations. But my journal including all final analyses, conclusions, and evaluations are the result of my keyboard. Also evaluated by ChatGPT. Hope this can be useful. And hopefully my teachers don't judge me.
