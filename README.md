# SIMP
SIMP doesn't stand for anything. SIMP is a reservation repository for everything I archived, including school projects.

# üìÉ What's included in here?
## 1. üë®‚Äçüî¨ Simple Mathematical Benchmarking for Natural Language Processing Models.
This is a Jupyter Notebook being used for school scientific journal on benchmarking lightweight natural language processing models. I would like to acknowledge the assistance of ChatGPT by OpenAI, which provided help in generating code templates and clarifying technical explanations. But my journal including all final analyses, conclusions, and evaluations are the result of my keyboard. Also evaluated by ChatGPT. Hope this can be useful. And hopefully my teachers don't judge me.

Anyway, the notebook is better be used on Google Colab with NVIDIA T4 runtime. Also Python 3 type of runtime. Also, I don't know. Maybe one day this notebook won't work. But atleast I've finished my journal, even I'm still working on it while I'm writing this. Will I ever have a better GitHub profile? I hope so.
